<h1>Law Of Conservation of Mass</h1>
<p >"In any chemical reaction ,the total mass of the reacting substancesis equal to the total mass of products of
 the reaction -provided masses,are measured under similar condtions"</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>If A & B react to form C & D then according to -<b>Law of conservation of mass</b>
  <table border=1 frame="box" rules="none">
  <tr>
  <td>Mass of A+Mass of B=Mass of C+Mass of D
  </tr>
  </table>
<b>Example:</b>
  <br>In formation of Iron[II] sulphide -by heating iron and sulphur .
56 parts of Fe&32 parts of sulphur chemically combine to form -88 parts of FeS
  <table border=1 frame="box" rules="none">
  <tr >
  <td >Mass of iron+
  <td>Mass of sulphur=
  <td>Mass of  iron [II] sulphide</tr>
   <tr >
   <td > 56
   <td>+32
   <td>=88
  </tr>
   </table>
